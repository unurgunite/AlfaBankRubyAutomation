  As a client
  I want to input mortgage conditions and make sure online calculator results match the numbers obtained manually.


  Scenario: Calculate mortgage annuity payment
    Given I open website
    And I have checked that calculator_header exists
    And I have checked that by_estate_price_link exists
    And I have checked that by_loan_sum_link exists
    And I have checked that down_payment_text exists
    And I have checked that loan_sum_text exists
    And I have checked that mortgage_term_text exists
    And I have checked that interest_rate_text exists
    And I have checked that monthly_payment_type_text exists
    And I have entered real_estate_cost price
    And I have selected percentage from RUB_currency_or_percentage dropdown window
    And I have entered mortgage_down_payment payment
    And I have entered mortgage_term term
    And I have selected years from years_or_months dropdown window
    And I have entered interest_rate
    And I have ticked the annuity radiobutton
    When I press submit button
    Then the monthly_payment should be equal to calculation on the screen
